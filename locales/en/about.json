  "description": "This mini-application was created to better understand how the i18n library works for implementing a multilingual interface on a website. The main goal is to explore methods for setting up translations, lazy loading content, and switching languages in real time. This project serves as a basic reference in case a multilingual site needs to be implemented in the future."
